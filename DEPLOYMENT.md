```

## 🚀 Deployment Options

### 1. **Netlify** (Recommended)

1. Drag and drop the `out/` folder to [Netlify](https://netlify.com)
2. Your site will be live instantly with a Netlify subdomain
3. Connect your GitHub repo for automatic deployments

### 2. **Vercel**

1. Install Vercel CLI: `npm i -g vercel`
2. Run: `vercel --prod` from the project root
3. Vercel will automatically detect Next.js and deploy

### 3. **GitHub Pages**

1. Push the `out/` folder to a GitHub repository
2. Enable GitHub Pages in repository settings
3. Set source to the branch containing the `out/` folder

### 4. **AWS S3 + CloudFront**

1. Upload `out/` folder contents to an S3 bucket
2. Configure the bucket for static website hosting
3. Set up CloudFront for CDN and HTTPS

### 5. **Any Web Server**

- Upload the contents of `out/` to any web server
- Configure the server to serve `index.html` for all routes
- Ensure all assets are accessible

## 🧪 Local Testing

The static site is currently running locally at:

- **URL**: http://localhost:8000
- **Stop server**: Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal
