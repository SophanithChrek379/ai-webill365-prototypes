# GitHub Pages Deployment Guide

This guide will help you deploy your Next.js static site to GitHub Pages.

## ✅ Current Status: DEPLOYMENT SETUP COMPLETE

Your project has been successfully configured for GitHub Pages deployment:

- ✅ Repository connected to: `https://github.com/SophanithChrek379/ai-webill365-prototypes.git`
- ✅ GitHub Actions workflow created: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
- ✅ Next.js static export configured in `next.config.ts`
- ✅ Code pushed to GitHub repository
- ✅ Build tested locally and working

## 🚀 Next Steps to Complete Deployment

### Step 1: Enable GitHub Pages in Repository Settings

1. Go to your GitHub repository: https://github.com/SophanithChrek379/ai-webill365-prototypes
2. Click on **Settings** tab
3. Scroll down to **Pages** in the left sidebar
4. Under **Source**, select **GitHub Actions**
5. This will enable the automatic deployment workflow

### Step 2: Monitor Deployment

1. Go to the **Actions** tab in your repository
2. You should see a workflow running called "Deploy to GitHub Pages"
3. The workflow will:
   - Build your Next.js project
   - Generate static files
   - Deploy to GitHub Pages

### Step 3: Access Your Site

Once deployment is complete, your site will be available at:

```
https://SophanithChrek379.github.io/ai-webill365-prototypes
```

## 🔧 Configuration Details

### Next.js Configuration (`next.config.ts`)

```typescript
const nextConfig: NextConfig = {
  output: "export", // Enables static export
  trailingSlash: true, // Required for GitHub Pages
  images: {
    unoptimized: true, // Required for static export
  },
  transpilePackages: ["bootstrap", "bootstrap-icons"],
};
```

### GitHub Actions Workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`)

- Automatically triggers on push to `main` branch
- Builds the project using Node.js 18
- Deploys static files to GitHub Pages
- Uses GitHub's latest deployment actions

## 📊 Build Information

Your project builds successfully with:

- **Total Pages**: 5 (Home, Dashboard, Subscribers, Logs, 404)
- **Build Size**: ~99.7 kB (First Load JS)
- **Static Export**: Generated in `out/` directory
- **Assets**: All images, flags, and styles included

## 🔄 Automatic Deployment

Every time you push changes to the `main` branch:

1. GitHub Actions automatically triggers
2. Project builds and generates static files
3. Site deploys to GitHub Pages
4. Updates are live within minutes

## 🛠️ Manual Deployment (if needed)

If you need to deploy manually:

```bash
# Build the project
npm run build

# Add and commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "Update site"

# Push to trigger automatic deployment
git push origin main
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **404 Errors on Navigation**

   - ✅ Fixed: `trailingSlash: true` in `next.config.ts`
   - ✅ Fixed: Static export properly configured

2. **Assets Not Loading**

   - ✅ Fixed: All assets in `public/assets/` directory
   - ✅ Fixed: Next.js static export handles assets correctly

3. **Build Failures**
   - ✅ Tested: Local build successful
   - ✅ Dependencies: All properly listed in `package.json`

### If Deployment Fails:

1. Check the **Actions** tab for error logs
2. Verify your repository settings
3. Ensure GitHub Pages is enabled with GitHub Actions source
4. Check that the repository is public (required for free accounts)

## 📱 Site Features

Your deployed site will include:

- ✅ Responsive design with Bootstrap 5.3.3
- ✅ Dashboard with data tables
- ✅ Subscribers management
- ✅ Logs viewing
- ✅ Modern UI with Weloop design system
- ✅ Mobile-first responsive layout
