# Next.js App Router Project Rules for Figma Design Integration (Updated)

## Project Structure

- Use Next.js 14 App Router structure
- Place pages in `app/` directory
- Place reusable components in `components/` directory
- Place styles in `styles/` directory
- Place static assets in `public/assets/` directory

## Component Development

- Use React functional components with TypeScript
- Create components in `components/` directory
- Use proper TypeScript interfaces for props
- Follow React best practices and hooks
- **Use only React-Bootstrap components for all UI elements**

## Styling Guidelines

- **Use Bootstrap@5.3.3 utility classes or custom Weloop utility/container classes for layout and spacing**
- **All custom styles and overrides must be written in SCSS format**
- **All design element styles must be defined in `src/styles/weloop/**` and referenced accordingly**
- Use CSS modules or styled-components for component-specific styles if needed
- Maintain responsive mobile-first design principles

## Figma Design Integration

- Export Figma images to `/public/assets/images/`
- Convert Figma colors to SCSS variables with semantic naming
- Extract typography styles from Figma and apply to Bootstrap@5.3.3 root config
- Maintain design system consistency

## File Organization

- Components: `components/ComponentName.tsx`
- Pages: `app/page.tsx`, `app/about/page.tsx`
- Layouts: `app/layout.tsx`
- Styles: `app/globals.scss`
- Assets: `public/assets/images/`, `public/assets/flag/`, `public/assets/fonts/`

## Code Quality

- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow ESLint rules and Next.js conventions
- Use proper import/export statements
- Maintain clean, readable code structure

## Design System

- Create reusable component library
- Use consistent spacing and typography
- Implement dark/light mode support
- Follow accessibility guidelines

## Asset Management

- **All images and resources must be placed in `public/assets/**` and referenced using the Next.js static asset conventions**
- **Never import images or resources from outside `public/assets/**`**

- Create reusable component library
- Use consistent spacing and typography
- Implement dark/light mode support
- Follow accessibility guidelines
